In the future, in order to accomodate load balancing across multiple planet-lab controllers,
a possible modification would be to move control of the individual scamper processes onto the VPs.
In order to requests a measurement, a planet-lab controller would make the measurement request through
rpc to the appropriate VP and receive the results. This would allow any single planet-lab controller
to issue measurements to any vantage point.
