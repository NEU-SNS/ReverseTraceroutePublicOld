# VPService

The Vantage Point Server tracks which vantage points are available for use as measurement 
sources by clients of the Controller. It also keeps track of IPv4 option capabilities of the 
active vantage points. It is able to return lists of VPs to use for Spoofed Record Route
and Timestamp measurements.
