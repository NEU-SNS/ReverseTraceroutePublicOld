package icmp

// ListenPacket listens for incoming ICMP packets addressed to
// address. See net.Dial for the syntax of address.
//
// For non-privileged datagram-oriented ICMP endpoints, network must
// be "udp4" or "udp6". The endpoint allows to read, write a few
// limited ICMP messages such as echo request and echo reply.
// Currently only Darwin and Linux support this.
//
// Examples:
//	ListenPacket("udp4", "192.168.0.1")
//	ListenPacket("udp4", "0.0.0.0")
//	ListenPacket("udp6", "fe80::1%en0")
//	ListenPacket("udp6", "::")
//
// For privileged raw ICMP endpoints, network must be "ip4" or "ip6"
// followed by a colon and an ICMP protocol number or name.
//
// Examples:
//	ListenPacket("ip4:icmp", "192.168.0.1")
//	ListenPacket("ip4:1", "0.0.0.0")
//	ListenPacket("ip6:ipv6-icmp", "fe80::1%en0")
//	ListenPacket("ip6:58", "::")
